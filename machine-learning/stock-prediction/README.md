# [How to Predict Stock Prices in Python using TensorFlow 2 and Keras](https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/stock-price-prediction-in-python-using-tensorflow-2-and-keras)

To run this:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Please read the [tutorial](https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/stock-price-prediction-in-python-using-tensorflow-2-and-keras) before using this, edit `parameters.py` for your needs and run `train.py`. This will start training using the parameters you specified, you can use `tensorboard` on `logs` folder to visualize your training process.
- Once you trained your model, use `test.py` to evaluate and test your model.
